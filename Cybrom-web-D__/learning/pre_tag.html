    Designation, Department
    
    Sub: annual leave application letter
    
    I’m writing this letter to request a 10-day annual leave starting from 10th Oct to 20th Oct 2020. I would like to utilize my annual leave quota of 21 days for these leaves. I am planning to go on a short vacation with my family. 
    
    In my absence, my colleague, Mr. Gupta will be taking care of the operations. In case there is an urgent need, please feel free to reach me on XXXXXXXX or email me at XXXXXX@gmail.com
    
    Please consider my leave request. Thank you for your time. 
    
    Yours sincerely
